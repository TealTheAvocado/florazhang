<p>It's August 12th and I did it! I made a website from scratch! It is a website I made for fun to use for <a href="https://studentsphere.org/" style="color:blue;">StudentSphere</a></p>

<p>No it's not the StudentSphere website. It's a website for <a href="https://tealtheavocado.github.io/mentor-resources/index.html" style="color:blue;">mentorship resources</a></p>

<p>Here's what it looks like today. I will be out of town for a week, so I will only be able to work on it afterwards.</p>
