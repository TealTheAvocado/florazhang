<p>I can't quite remember exactly where I left off last time. But I have officially started at OSU now! Honestly not really like discrete, but I also don't think I'm terrible at it. Hopefully this initial feeling is enough for me to get through the class.</p>

<p>I decided that I am officially done with the mentorship resources website. I haven't had the most time to produce any actual projects because of LeetCode and Internship Apps. I also recently visited Illinois/Indiana for the first time and got a glimpse of the college life in the midwest. </p>

<p>As usual, I have made a new Github page (linked below with a button of course. Not sure if there's any sort of copyright issues with calling it a "Link Tree" but I think that it's fine. </p>
<button onclick="window.location.href='https://tealtheavocado.github.io/link-tree/'">"Link Tree"</button>

<p>As the school year progresses, and I'm sure I'll get more busy, I would like to still occasionally update this website. Though it might just be monthly updates or when something amazing like getting an internship offer happens, I want to keep updating with blogposts because that's what I love to do. I have a terrible memory, so recording my life through photos, blog posts, etc. is so so important to me.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you're reading this, you're a real one and I hope my interactions with you reflect that. </p>
