<p>Since I am a few classes into this program, I figured I’d put together some resources and thoughts so far!</p>

<h3>Program overview:</h3>
<p>First off, let’s go over what the program I am doing right now is. It’s an online post-baccalaureate program, so you have to already have a bachelor’s in something other than computer science. It is through Oregon State University’s E-campus. It is 60 units (on the quarter system), and consists of a lot of different computer science classes. You will not have to take any classes outside of computer science except for discrete math.</p>

<h3>Classes I have taken so far:</h3>
<p>CS 161 Intro to CS I(at a CC)<br>
    CS 162 Intro to CS II<br>
    CS 225 Discrete Math<br>
    CS 391 Ethics in CS<br>
    CS 290 Web Development<br>
    CS 352 Intro to Usability Engineering<br>
    CS 261 (in progress) Data Structures</p>

<h3>Things to know before you start:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>If you haven’t done much research into what classes you are taking in the beginning, be warned that you might not be able to be a full time student your first quarter or two because you need to take the intro classes to unlock more classes.</li>
    <li>This program is expensive! I think it is more expensive than most undergrad in person programs, so I would suggest looking into the community college equivalents for the first few classes you take. Although I will say the quality of teaching will probably be different.</li>
    <li>Think about if you want to apply to summer internships and plan your course load around that.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Thoughts about the program in general:</h3>
<p>I love the OSU community. I think the TA’s are very helpful. And because it is an online program, there is a large online community. You will be able to find people in your classes even though everything is virtual. Most people work full time, so if you don’t, you should be aware of this if you are working together with others because you might find it hard to match schedules.</p>
<p>Online classes are online classes. I think the quality of the content will really depend on the class. Personally, I like watching videos a lot more than just reading text. Most classes will have both, but some are more video heavy and some are more reading heavy. I feel like because I took UCSB’s classes that were meant to be in person online (due to COVID in 2020), I got really used to watching full lectures online. But I think you learn to adapt and find other resources if you feel like there are gaps in your knowledge. </p>

<h3>Get involved:</h3>
<p>Honestly I think there aren’t too many clubs that are hybrid or fully online, but one that I know is super accessible to online students is OSU Hackathon Club/Beaverhacks (<a href="https://www.beaverhacks.com/">www.beaverhacks.com</a>)! I was actually VP for a bit before my internship. Attending hackathons is a great way to be more involved in the community and for adding projects to your resume.
