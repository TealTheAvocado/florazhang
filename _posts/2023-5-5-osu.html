<p>Since I am a few classes into this program, I figured I’d put together some resources and 
    thoughts so far!</p>

<h3>Program overview:</h3>
<p>First off, let’s go over what the program I am doing right now is. It’s an online 
    post-baccalaureate program, so you have to already have a bachelor’s in something other 
    than computer science. It is through Oregon State University’s E-campus. It is 60 units 
    (on the quarter system), and consists of a lot of different computer science classes. 
    You will not have to take any classes outside of computer science except for discrete math.
</p>

<h3>Classes I have taken so far:</h3>
<p>CS 161 Intro to CS I(at a CC)<br>
    CS 162 Intro to CS II<br>
    CS 225 Discrete Math<br>
    CS 391 Ethics in CS<br>
    CS 290 Web Development<br>
    CS 352 Intro to Usability Engineering<br>
    CS 261 (in progress) Data Structures</p>

<h3>Things to know before you start:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>If you haven’t done much research into what classes you are taking in the beginning, be warned that you might not be able to be a full time student your first quarter or two because you need to take the intro classes to unlock more classes.</li>
    <li>This program is expensive! I think it is more expensive than most undergrad in person programs, so I would suggest looking into the community college equivalents for the first few classes you take. Although I will say the quality of teaching will probably be different.</li>
    <li>Think about if you want to apply to summer internships and plan your course load around that.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Why you should or shouldn’t do this program:</h3>
<p><b>Should:</b> I think you should do this program if you do not have a background in computer science (less than one or two classes). This is because this program is so introductory and you will be relearning things if you have taken more than a few classes because you can only transfer in so many classes. This program is also nice if you work part time or full time because it is completely asynchronous. If you have time to do a summer internship, this program is great for getting you past the resume screening. I should be finishing June 2024, and that is the ideal graduation date for those pursuing summer 2023 internships because then the company can give you a return offer after your internship (assuming it goes well).</p>
<p><b>Shouldn't:</b> I think you shouldn’t do this program if you have a background already (a bootcamp or taken more than 2 classes in computer science). I think you are better off pursuing a masters. A graduate degree will likely be expensive, but again, this program is also expensive. If you struggle with online learning a lot, you would probably be better off with some sort of in person program.
</p>

<h3>Thoughts about the program in general:</h3>
<p>I love the OSU community. I think the TA’s are very helpful. And because it is an online program, there is a large online community. You will be able to find people in your classes even though everything is virtual. Most people work full time, so if you don’t, you should be aware of this if you are working together with others because you might find it hard to match schedules.</p>
<p>Online classes are online classes. I think the quality of the content will really depend on the class. Personally, I like watching videos a lot more than just reading text. Most classes will have both, but some are more video heavy and some are more reading heavy. I feel like because I took UCSB’s classes that were meant to be in person online (due to COVID in 2020), I got really used to watching full lectures online. But I think you learn to adapt and find other resources if you feel like there are gaps in your knowledge. Most of the TA's for the classes are super super helpful, so make sure to go to office hours a lot, especially when it's farther away from the deadline.</p>

<h3>Get involved:</h3>
<p>
    Honestly I think there aren’t too many clubs that are hybrid or fully online, but one that I know is super accessible to online students is OSU Hackathon Club/Beaverhacks (<a href="https://www.beaverhacks.com/">www.beaverhacks.com</a>)! I was actually VP for a bit before my internship. Attending hackathons is a great way to be more involved in the community and for adding projects to your resume. 
    I know OSU App Development Club is also hyrbid.
</p>

<h3>Notes on specific classes:</h3>
<p>CS 162: It has a few assignments that were fairly difficult for me because I feel like I didn’t get a strong understanding of object oriented programming from the cc-equivalent class I took for intro to cs I. Be careful of the hidden tests! Just because you pass the visible tests does not mean that you will get 100% on the assignment so go to office hours!</p>

<p>CS 225: This class is not easy for most people. Make sure you have reviewed basic algebra if you haven’t done it in a while. Take advantage of office hours and make sure to do the practice tests because they are very similar to the actual tests. The final is proctored, but I had no issues when I took it.</p>

<p>CS 290: This class is nice if you are missing side projects because the final project is a website you can use as a portfolio website. This class also gives you the skills to create a separate portfolio website if you want. </p>

<p>CS 352: This is a nice filler elective class unless you are really interested in usability engineering. For me, it was just a nice group project class because my group was very nice and everyone did their work for the most part. </p>

<p>CS 261: The lectures are very very minimal in this class. I have done a good amount of leetcode so I think I understand the underlying concepts so far. If you do not have any background knowledge on data structures, you will need to find a lot of supplementary material such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IAPZzGSbME&list=PLAXnLdrLnQpRcveZTtD644gM9uzYqJCwr">Abdul Bari</a></p>
