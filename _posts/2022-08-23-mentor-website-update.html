<p>I have finally had some time to make some edits. One day I'll redo this website, although not today.</p>

<p>This is what the homepage now looks like. I want to make it longer so you can scroll more. I also need to figure out how the navigation bar works on mobile so I can maybe update that too.</p>

<p>I spent a good amount of time trying to update a contact form onto this website, but I ended up just using formspree again.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with formpree. I just wanted to use something that was coded on my own. BUT Github Pages does not do that and I am using that as the way I upload these websites.</p>

<p>Anyways I'll be trying to update this website as much as I can with what I'm learning.</p>
