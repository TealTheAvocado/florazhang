<p>Oh boy it has been a while since I last posted. </p>

<p>Here are the updates:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I received an offer for an internship next summer! I won’t release full details until closer to the date, but I’m so excited for it!</li>
    <li>I finished a new project called <a href="https://tealtheavocado.github.io/valorant-smokes/index.html">VALORANT Setups</a> because I just got so into val the past few months. It’s just the bare bones for now, buttttt we’ll see how much more I end up adding. </li>
    <li>Oh welp i think thats it</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyways, I am greatly looking forwards to what I’m learning next quarter as well as just for more career advances!! Wooooo keeping it short and sweet today :)</p>
