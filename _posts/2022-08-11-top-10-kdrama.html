<p>Since I’m starting a blog anyways. I want to share my favorite K-dramas of all time. I took a little bit of a hiatus from watching K-dramas from about 2017-2021, but I have been getting back into them. In order to make this list, they must have a 10/10 rating on my <a href="https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/florazhang">MyDramaList</a> and be a drama I can see myself rewatching even today. I think a lot of the ratings are skewed because I watched them so young so that’s why there’s a second clause to make this list.</p>

<h3>1. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/8550-emergency-couple">Emergency Couple</a></h3>
<p>This was my very first drama. It was still airing when I watched it and I remember anticipating every episode as the weeks went on. That was over 8 years ago, which to mee seems very crazy. I have yet to rewatch it in the past couple of years, but I could definitely see myself rewatching it.</p>

<h3>2. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/693591-in-house-confrontation">A Business Proposal</a></h3>
<p>This gets number 2 because it really reinvigorated my love for K-dramas. It is very cheesy, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cheesiness and the relationship between both the main couple and the second couple.</p>

<h3>3. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/18894-strong-woman-do-bong-soon">Strong Woman Do Bong Soon</a></h3>
<p>This is a classic favorite. Although it came out in 2017, I want to include it into the golden era of 2016 dramas. It’s very cute and hilarious. </p>

<h3>4. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/13476-hello-monster">Hello Monster/I Remember You</a></h3>
<p>I don’t think this drama has the highest of ratings, but I love Seo In Guk and Jang Na Ra. I grew up watching the C-drama Bratty Princess, which Jang Na Ra is the main character, so maybe there is bias. But after all this is my top 10 list. I really like the cute wholesome dramas, but I do appreciate the casual more serious dark drama. I also loved Park Bo Gum’s character.</p>

<h3>5. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/6756-the-masters-sun">The Master's Sun</a></h3>
<p>This drama scared me so much when I watched it. It is also a classic in my opinion. It felt like a very unique plot at the time, and I think it still is. The acting is great and although I think some other people disagree, I liked the chemistry of the main leads.</p>

<h3>6. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/9288-youre-all-surrounded">You're All Surrounded</a></h3>
<p>I think this drama gets a pass for the “main characters actually knew each other from childhood” trope. It is literally based around his childhood trauma. I think the plot twist character actually caught me off guard. </p>

<h3>7. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/12360-falling-for-innocence">Falling for Innocence</a></h3>
<p>I don’t think this drama would be in a lot of people’s top 10, but I feel like I can rewatch this many, many times. It is another serious that I ended up really liking.</p>

<h3>8. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/10904-descendants-of-the-sun">Descendants of the Sun</a></h3>
<p>Everyone and their mother loved this drama. It was the peak of the golden 2016 era. I actually did not like it at first because I felt the first few episodes did not make a lot of sense to me. But I remember sobbing during the sad episode. The OST of this drama also really stands out. I still love all of the songs. </p>

<h3>9. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/7398-you-who-came-from-the-stars">My Love From Another Star</a></h3>
<p>Another crowd favorite, although from 2013. I think this drama was also very popular in China. I honestly need a rewatch because I can’t remember that much, but I remember it feeling revolutionary and crying during this one too.</p>

<h3>10. <a href="https://mydramalist.com/8539-bride-of-the-century">Bride of the Century</a></h3>
<p>This is another drama I don’t feel like a lot of people know about or love. Maybe it’s because I loved Lee Hong Gi at the time, and still love the characters he has played, but I really liked the chemistry between the main leads here too. I also adored the female lead and her acting.</p>

<p>Obviously this list is subject to change and I’ll maybe make an updated list someday. The picture for this post obviously has to be when I saw Lee Min Ho in person at K-CON 2016. He really ignited my love for K-dramas.</p>
