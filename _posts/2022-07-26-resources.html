<p>As of July 26th, 2022</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Odin Project</h2>

<p>With my minimal experience in HTML and CSS, I will be attempting to finish the Odin Project this summer. We shall see how it goes, and I will be updating here if anyone wants to check!</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">Udacity</h2>

<p>I specifically did the free Intro to HTML and CSS class. The UI is very nice and it was a nice intro to the languages, but it is very much just an introduction. This is definity for the first glance</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">CS50</h2>

<p>I technically only did the first 4 weeks because I was lazy and life happened. I did the original version in C, but I think if I were to start again I would do the Python version because that is what most of my classes will be in. I think it is very helpful at understanding the "why" for many of the elements of computer science. Again, I did not finish it so maybe there is a lot more knowledge I am missing out on.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">A 100 Days of Code Course on Udemy</h2>

<p>I am too lazy to look up the class as I was suggested to not finish that course and instead start CS50. I think it was fun and there were challenges that were difficult. But I think it's probably more important to start with the fundamentals in a more formal setting</p>

<p>The background pic for this is probably a placeholder for now. I can't think of what to put.</p>
