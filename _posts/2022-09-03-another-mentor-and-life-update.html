<p>So I'm going to try to not make anything redundant, but I made an Instagram to document my journey! I probably won't be updating my projects in these blog posts any more. So here's the latest news for the mentor resources website, which again, can be found <a href='https://tealtheavocado.github.io/mentor-resources/index.html'>here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/flora2swe/">Instagram</a> will document my progression through LeetCode problems, projects, applications, etc. I even used a cute Canva format for the posts. This account has also motivated me to post more on Tik Tok too, but we'll see how long this lasts.</p>

<p>Anyways, here are the changes:</p>

<h3>Navigation bar</h3>
<p>I decided the half working fixed position bar was not good enough, so now the navigation bar just stays at the top and moves away if you scroll. I tried a bunch of different combinations to make it look better but where it's at right now is probably the best for me. I also have a small problem where theres a little bit of whitespace above the navigation bar, but only on the homepage. I still can't figure out why this is but I am going to put that off to another day.</p>

<h3>More resources</h3>
<p>I've spent a couple of hours researching websites to add as resources. Some of them aren't as great as others, but they're all free and you can get something out of it.</p>

<h3>Search bars!!</h3>
<p>I added search bars on each page so you can search by the title of the website, the grade you're looking for, or by my comments on the website. </p>
