<p>Hi person! As you may or may not know already, my name is Flora Zhang. I graduated from UCSB with a degree in biology, and I am now pursuing my second bachelor's in computer science! </p>

<p>I love playing Pokemon Go and rodents. Those are probably the most prominent things about me. I have a pet hamster named Gibbs.</p>

<p>Here's Gibbs! Yes, he is named after Gibbs Free Energy. </p>
<p>And yes, the background picture for this page is a sunset again. Because as a former student at UCSB, it would be a tragedy if you did not take endless pictures of the sunset.</p>
