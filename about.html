        <p>Hi person! As you may or may not know already, my name is Flora Zhang. I graduated from UCSB with a degree 
            in biology, and I am now pursuing my second bachelor's in computer science!</p>
        <p>I interned at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory during spring 2023. I was able to work on a lot of cool stuff, 
            but primarily I contributed to this <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-44172-w'>paper</a>!</p>
        <p>Then in summer 2023, I interned as a software engineering intern at Avanade! It was so amazing to live in Seattle 
            for the summer.</p>

        <p>Here's Gibbs! Yes, he is named after Gibbs Free Energy. </p>
        <p>And yes, the background picture for this page is a sunset again. 
            Because as a former student at UCSB, it would be a tragedy if you did not take endless 
            pictures of the sunset.</p>
